Singleton Pattern belongs to Creational Type Pattern

This Pattern is used when we need to ensure that only one object of a particular class need to be created.
Singleton is like a single resource which is being shared among multiple users; for example - sharing a single washing machine among all the residents in a hotel or sharing a single appliance like refrigerator among all the family members.

From Wikipedia, "The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.‚Äù

I would rather say that singleton pattern ensures that single instance of a class is created and shared among all other objects in an application.

Advantages of Singleton
- Singleton controls concurrent access to the resource
- It ensures there is only one object available across the application in a controlled state.

Implementation Guidelines
- Ensure that only one instance of the class exists
- Provide global access to that instance by
  - Declaring all constructors of the class to be private
  - Providing static method that returns a reference to the instance
  - The instance is stored as a private static variable
