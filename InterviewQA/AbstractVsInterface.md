Abstract classes Vs Interfaces
Abstract classes can have implementations for some of its members (Methods), but the
interface can't have implementation for any of its members.
Interfaces cannot have fields where as an abstract class can have fields.
An interface can inherit from another interface only and cannot inherit from an abstract
class, where as an abstract class can inherit from another abstract class or another
interface.
A class can inherit from multiple interfaces at the same time, where as a class cannot
inherit from multiple classes at the same time.
Abstract class members can have access modifiers where as interface members cannot
have access modifiers.
Interface methods are public and Abstract methods are private by default.
